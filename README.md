# Beginning of Node js

Since I started my career as a front-end, I have always wondered how the back-end is working and what goes on behind the scenes. I started learning a backend language so that it would make my job easier when I work with the backend dev as a frontend dev, and also so that I could learn it myself. I love writing Javascript. That's why I did a self-study with JavaScript's Node JS so that I wouldn't learn a new syntax. I took Jonas Schmedtman's Node JS Udemy course and started. I've been watching his videos for a while. That's why I didn't put a repo on my github. This will be my first backend-related repo(it is not related to the backend yet. Just simple things). Actually, it is related to the Udemy project but I also write some codes. If you see some HTML things, don't mind. It just provides some visual things to understand what I write.

## How to run

```bash
node index.js
```

## Usage
These were my first  Node JS modules
```javascript
// It provides functionality to create an HTTP server and handle HTTP requests and responses.
const http = require('http');

//The 'fs' module stands for "file system" and provides methods for files
const fs = require('fs');

//The 'url' module provides utilities for working with URLs, such as parsing URL strings.
const url = require('url');

```
